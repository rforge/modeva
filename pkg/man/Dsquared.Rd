\title{
Proportion of deviance explained by a GLM
}
\description{
This function calculates the (adjusted) amount of deviance accounted for by a generalized linear model.
}
\usage{
Dsquared(model = NULL, obs = NULL, pred = NULL, family = NULL, adjust = FALSE, 
npar = NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{model}{a model object of class "glm".}
  \item{obs}{a numeric vector of the observed data. This argument is ignored if \code{model} is provided.}
  \item{pred}{a numeric vector of the values predicted by a GLM of the observed data. This argument is ignored if \code{model} is provided. Must be of the same length and in the same order as \code{obs}.}
  \item{family}{a character vector (i.e. in quotes) of length 1 specifying the family of the GLM. This argument is ignored if \code{model} is provided; otherwise (i.e. if 'obs' and 'pred' are provided rather than a model object), only families 'binomial' (logit link) and 'poisson' (log link) are currently implemented.}
  \item{adjust}{logical, whether or not to adjust the D-squared value for the number of observations and parameters in the model (see Details). The default is \code{FALSE}; \code{TRUE} requires either providing the \code{model} object, or specifying the number of parameters in the model that produced the \code{pred} values.}
  \item{npar}{an integer vector indicating the number of parameters in the model. This argument is ignored if \code{model} is provided or if \code{adjust = FALSE}.}
}
\details{
Linear models come with an R-squared value that measures the proportion of variation that the model accounts for. The R-squared is provided with \code{summary(model)} in R. For generalized linear models (GLMs), the equivalent is the amount of deviance accounted for (D-squared; Guisan & Zimmermann 2000), but this value is not normally provided with the model summary. The \code{Dsquared} function calculates it. There is also an option to calculate the adjusted D-squared, which takes into account the number of observations and the number of predictors, thus allowing direct comparison among different models (Weisberg 1980, Guisan & Zimmermann 2000).

\examples{
# load sample models:
data(rotif.mods)

# choose a particular model to play with:
mod <- rotif.mods$models[[1]]

Dsquared(model = mod)

Dsquared(model = mod, adjust = TRUE)


# you can also use Dsquared with vectors of observed and predicted values
# instead of with a model object:

presabs <- mod$y
prediction <- mod$fitted.values
parameters <- attributes(logLik(mod))$df

Dsquared(obs = presabs, pred = prediction, family = "binomial")

Dsquared(obs = presabs, pred = prediction, family = "binomial", adjust = TRUE, 
npar = parameters)
