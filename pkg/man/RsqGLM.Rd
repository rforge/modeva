\title{R-squared measures for GLMs}
\description{
This function calculates some (pseudo) R-squared statistics for binomial Generalized Linear Models.
}
\usage{
RsqGLM(model = NULL, obs = NULL, pred = NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{model}{instead of (and overriding) \code{obs} and \code{pred}, you can provide a model object of class "glm" and family "binomial".}
  \item{obs}{a vector of observed presences (1) and absences (0) or another
  binary response variable.}
  \item{pred}{a vector with the corresponding predicted values of presence probability. Must be of the same length and in the same order as \code{obs}.}
}
\details{
Implemented measures include the R-squareds of McFadden (1974), Cox-Snell (1989), Nagelkerke (1991, which corresponds to the corrected Cox-Snell, eliminating its upper bound), and Tjur (2009). See Allison (2014) for a brief review of these measures.

\value{The function returns a named list of the calculated R-squared values.}

Tjur's R-squared can only be calculated for models with binomial response variable; otherwise, NA will be returned.

\examples{
# load sample models:
data(rotif.mods)

# choose a particular model to play with:
mod <- rotif.mods$models[[1]]

RsqGLM(model = mod)


# you can also use RsqGLM with vectors of observed and predicted values
# instead of a model object:

RsqGLM(obs = mod$y, pred = mod$fitted.values)
