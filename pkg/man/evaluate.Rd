\title{
Evaluate a GLM based on the elements of a confusion matrix.
}
\description{
This functions evaluates the discrimination performance of a model based on the values of a confusion matrix obtained at a particular threshold.
}
\usage{
evaluate(a, b, c, d, N = NULL, measure = "CCR")
}
\arguments{
  \item{a}{number of correctly predicted presences}
  \item{b}{number of absences incorrectly predicted as presences}
  \item{c}{number of presences incorrectly predicted as absences
}
  \item{d}{number of correctly predicted absences}
  \item{N}{total number of cases. If NULL (the dafault) it is calculated automatically by adding up a, b, c and d.)}
  \item{measure}{a character vector of length 1 indicating the the evaluation measure to use. Type \code{modEvAmethods("threshMeasures")} for available options.}
}
\details{
A number of measures can be used to evaluate continuous model predictions against observed binary occurrence data (Fielding & Bell 1997; Liu et al. 2011; Barbosa et al. 2013). The \code{evaluate} function can calculate a few threshold-based discrimination measures from the values of a confusion matrix obtained at a particular threshold. The \code{evaluate} function is used internally by \code{\link{threshMeasures}}. It can also be accessed directly by the user, but it is usually more practical to use \code{\link{threshMeasures}}, which calculates the confusion matrix automatically.
}
\value{
The value of the specified evaluation measure.
