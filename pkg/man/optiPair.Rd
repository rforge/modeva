\title{
Optimize the discrimination threshold for a pair of related
model evaluation measures.
}
\description{
The optiPair function can optimize a model's discrimination threshold based on
a pair of model evaluation measures that balance each other, such as
sensitivity-specificity, omission-commission, or underprediction-overprediction
(Fielding & Bell 1997; Liu et al. 2011; Barbosa et al. 2013). The function plots
both measures in the given pair against all thresholds with a given interval, and
calculates the optimal sum, difference and mean of the two measures.
}
\usage{
optiPair(model = NULL, obs = NULL, pred = NULL,
measures = c("Sensitivity", "Specificity"), interval = 0.01, plot = TRUE,
plot.sum = FALSE, plot.diff = FALSE, ylim = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{model}{a model object of class "glm".}
  \item{obs}{a vector of observed presences (1) and absences (0) or another
  binary response variable. This argument is ignored if \code{model} is provided.}
  \item{pred}{a vector with the corresponding predicted values of presence
  probability, habitat suitability, environmental favourability or alike. This argument is ignored if \code{model} is provided.}
  \item{measures}{a character vector of length 2 indicating the pair of measures
  whose curves to plot and whose thresholds to optimize. The default is
  \code{c("Sensitivity", "Specificity")}.}
  \item{interval}{the interval of thresholds at which to calculate the measures. The default is 0.01.}
  \item{plot}{logical indicating whether or not to plot the pair of measures.}
  \item{plot.sum}{logical, whether to plot the sum (+) of both measures in the pair. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
  \item{plot.diff}{logical, whether to plot the difference (-) between both measures in the pair. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
  \item{ylim}{a character vector of length 2 indicating the lower and upper limits for the y axis. The default is \code{NULL} for an automatic definition of \code{ylim} based on the values of the measures and their sum and/or difference if any of these are set to \code{TRUE}.}
  \item{\dots}{additional arguments to be passed to the \code{plot} function.}
}

\value{
The output is a list with the following components:
\item{measures.values}{a data frame with the values of the chosen pair of measures, as well as their difference, sum and mean, at each threshold.}
\item{MinDiff}{numeric value, the minimum difference between both measures.}
\item{ThreshDiff}{numeric value, the threshold that minimizes the difference between both measures.}
\item{MaxSum}{numeric value, the maximum sum of both measures.}
\item{ThreshSum}{numeric value, the threshold that maximizes the sum of both measures.}
\item{MaxMean}{numeric value, the maximum mean of both measures.}
\item{ThreshMean}{numeric value, the threshold that maximizes the mean of both measures.}

# load sample models:
data(rotif.mods)

# choose a particular model to play with:
mod <- rotif.mods$models[[1]]

optiPair(model = mod)

optiPair(model = mod, measures = c("UPR", "OPR"))


# you can also use optiPair with vectors of observed and predicted values
